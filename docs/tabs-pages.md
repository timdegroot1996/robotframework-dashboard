# Tabs / Pages

## Overview Page
The Overview page provides a high-level summary of all test runs, highlighting the latest results for each project. It shows key metrics such as pass/fail/skip counts, recent trends, and overall performance, enabling users to quickly assess the health of their test suites. You can also filter to display all runs for a specific project or custom project tags (see [Advanced CLI & Examples](advanced-cli-examples.md#project-tagging)), which helps visualize historical trends through donut charts, duration data, and pass percentage statistics.

## Dashboard Page
The Dashboard page offers rich, interactive visualizations for a detailed analysis of test results. Graphs are available at four levels—runs, suites, tests, and keywords—allowing teams to track performance, detect flaky tests, and monitor trends over time. The layout is fully customizable (see [Filtering & Customization](filtering-customization.md)). You can drag and drop graphs and sections to create your preferred view. Most graphs support multiple display modes, including timeline, percentage, bar, donut, and advanced types like boxplots and heatmaps. Each graph also provides detailed popups to explain what the view represents and how the data is calculated (see [Graphs & Tables](graphs-tables.md)).

## Compare Page
The Compare page enables side-by-side comparison of up to four test runs. It presents comprehensive statistics, charts, and summaries for each run, making it simple to identify differences, trends, regressions, or improvements between builds or environments.

## Tables Page
The Tables page gives direct access to the raw data stored in the database. It displays detailed tables for runs, suites, tests, and keywords, making it perfect for debugging, verifying imported data, or performing ad-hoc analyses.
