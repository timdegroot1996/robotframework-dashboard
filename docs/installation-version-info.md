# Installation & Version Info

Learn how to install RobotFramework Dashboard and check compatibility requirements. This page explains installation steps, supported versions, and important system notes.

## Installation

Before installing the dashboard, ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your system. You also need **Robot Framework 6.0 or higher**.

### Install Robot Framework
If Robot Framework is not already installed, run:

```bash
pip install robotframework>=6.0
```

### Install Robot Framework Dashboard
Install the dashboard using pip:

```bash
pip install robotframework-dashboard
```

### Install Robot Framework Dashboard Server

The server can be installed separately and is not installed by default.
This has ben done to reduce dependencies that are required only for the server like `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.

Install Robot Framework Dashboard with Server:
```bash
pip install robotframework-dashboard[server]
pip install robotframework-dashboard[all]
```

### Dependencies
This will automatically install the required dependencies:
- robotframework>=6.0 – the core testing framework
- fastapi>=0.115.11 – the web framework used for the dashboard server
- uvicorn>=0.33.0 – the ASGI server to run the dashboard

Note: FastAPI and Uvicorn are only needed if you intend to run the dashboard web server.

## Version Details

### Supported Robot Framework Versions
The Robot Framework Dashboard has been tested with the following Robot Framework versions:
6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2, 6.1, 6.1.1, 7.0, 7.0.1, 7.1, 7.1.1, 7.2, 7.2.1, 7.2.2, 7.3, 7.3.1

### Compatibility notes:
- When running robotdashboard with Robot Framework 6.x, output files generated by Robot 7.x will have no duration fields when processed. This is due to changes in the Result Visitor model.
- When running robotdashboard with Robot Framework 7.x, output files generated by any version above 6.x should be processed correctly.

### Quick Verification
To verify the installation:

```bash
robot --version
robotdashboard --help
```
This ensures both Robot Framework and the dashboard are installed correctly and are in your PATH.
