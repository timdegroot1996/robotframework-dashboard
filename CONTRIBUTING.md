## ⚙️ Validate changes without installing the package
Sometimes it can be quite time consuming to constantly install (pip install .) the entire package to your python version.
To still run the code you can use the following command to run from the package itself. You can add all cli options you desire.
```sh
python -m robotframework_dashboard.main -n robot_dashboard.html
```
It is a good practice to make sure that after everything works like you expect to still install the package and run the same command from the installed version.
All commands should be executed from the root of the project, and can contain the same cli options as above.
```sh
pip install .
robotdashboard -n robot_dashboard.html
```

## ✅ Tests
Tests are located in `atest`. There are different tests for the different parts of the tool.

- CLI
- Database
- Dashboard

Tests will run automatically in GitHub actions. They are triggered through the `.github/workflows/tests.yml` yml script. In this script details regarding the test pipeline can be found. The tests will run when:

- Creating a PR
- Pushing a commit to a PR
- Manually rerunning a workflow run in GitHub actions

Results can be found at the `PR > checks > Upload robot logs`.
The check will have a failed status if any tests has failed.
