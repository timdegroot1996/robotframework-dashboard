## 🎯 Overview

Robot Framework Dashboard is a tool for [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) that provides insight of your test results across multiple runs. The tool makes use of the built in Robot Framework [Result Visitor API](https://robot-framework.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_modules/robot/result/visitor.html) to analyse output.xml files, stores these in a simple sqlite3 database and finally creates a HTML dashboard that makes use of [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) and [Datatables](https://datatables.net/) for the graphs and tables and makes use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling. Additionally [GridStack](https://gridstackjs.com/) is used for the interactive layout grids.
